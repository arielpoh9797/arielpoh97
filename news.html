						<h3>Jone's fruit stall making fruits business good again</h3>
						<h6>12-5-2019 Monday / Albert Street</h6>
						Jonesâ€™ fruit stall has been in operation at the corner of Church and Albert Street in downtown Belize City for the past four years, but he told the Reporter that over the course of fifteen years, due to a major fire downtown and more recent renovations, the family business has been relocated several times.
						Every morning at 4:00 a.m. Jones would get up and travel from his home in Sandhill Village to pick up his fresh fruits at the market. He would then head over to the location to prepare and bag off his goods and set up his wares for 6:00a.m. when commuters would start moving through the busy business strip.
						Jones told the Reporter that since he was a very small child he got interested in running the business because he noticed that every day he would be greeted with a new adventure and experience as he interacted and met new people.

					<h3>New stand opened in Nottingshamshire</h3>
					<h6>10-5-2019 Sunday / Nottinghamshire street</h6>
					A fresh fruit and veg stall has opened outside the main entrance of a Nottinghamshire hospital.
					The new stand opened Kings Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield on Monday, January 7.
					The decision to add the stall came from Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which operates the site, in a bid to encourage healthy eating for staff, visitors and patients at Kings Mill Hospital.
					Laiten McGuigan and Roxanne Burrows, who are both from Leicester, will be running the stall which will be open Monday to Friday, from 8.30am until 4.30pm and will accept both cash and card payments.
